Implement multi-language support in your LVGL Pro projects using the XML translation module to define and manage translated strings efficiently.

## Overview

The XML translation module allows defining and using translated strings
directly within XML files.

It's built on top of LVGL's translation module.

Check [LVGL's translation module documentation](https://lvgl.io/docs/open/main-modules/translation) to learn more about selecting the active language,
retrieving translations, and fallback behavior.

## Usage

Example XML translation definition:

``` xml
<translations languages="en de hu">
 <translation tag="dog" en="The dog" de="Der Hund" hu="A kutya"/>
 <translation tag="cat" en="The cat" de="Die Katze" hu="A cica"/>
 <translation tag="snake" en="A snake" de="Eine Schlange" hu="A kígyó"/>
</translations>
```

In the root `translations` tag, the `languages` attribute defines the
available languages, e.g., `languages="en de hu"`. Language codes are
free-form, but ISO-style codes are recommended.

Each `translation` defines a `tag`, which acts as the lookup key, and
attributes for each language.

Translations may be omitted — fallbacks will be applied when needed.
Refer to the [LVGL translation](https://lvgl.io/docs/open/main-modules/translation) module documentation for details on fallback behavior.

## Code export

Based on the translations defined in XML, C code is exported in the format required by the
[Translation module of LVGL](https://lvgl.io/docs/open/main-modules/translation), and it is also
registered automatically when the UI is initialized.

## Relation to fonts

To effectively handle Asian (e.g. Chinese, Japanese, or Korean) characters it's recommended to use a
`<tiny_ttf>` font, as it loads the characters to draw on demand from a single TTF file. This way:

1. Any character can be rendered (assuming the font supports it)
2. Any size can be rendered

If you would like to use a C array font instead, it's recommended to use the `fallback` feature of the
fonts to chain multiple fonts, e.g. one per language.
